my notes on getting windows games to work under linux

Find each game in its respective subfolder and see the README.md for that game. If there are associated modding tools for a game, they will have corresponding subfolders below the game. I will note in the game's README.md when and what hardware/os/version of the game was tested. Generally speaking, I tend to prefer the proton versions of games over the native versions. It is not that I don't appreciate native builds or that I don't desire them. But is has been my experience that many native linux builds are either poorly supported, perform worse than the proton versions, have issues not present in the proton versions, and/or are lacking features that the proton versions have. Stability/performance/feature set are more important to me and will come first.


I will try to add to these as I get time. I have some older notes that I need to get cleaned up and I will add those here too. If you have suggestions for better compatibility, please feel free to report it as an issue and I will look at it as I get time. I don't mind adding notes or making minor adjustments for better compatibility; that said, I probably will not go too far out of my way to support Mac/BSD or Linux distros that are drastically different from my own (I generally run the latest version of Mint or 1 behind).
