zilav is programming the installer, not me
and it's not in C#, it's in object pascal

mpi's are basically zip files /s
Just throw it in the downloads folder of MO2

RoyBatty11/06/2018
except as xdelta3 patches
which is what we do

Razbros01/05/2019
No problem. Thanks for trying anyway man! I appreciate it
Is there no way for a manual install, bypassing the installer?

RoyBatty01/05/2019
it's not possible, the installer uses xdelta3 to patch the original files
the download would be illegal and around 10GB

I tried to update to 3.2.1
But then it tells me my game version is incorrect or something
file version
idk
TTW files have incorrect version

[couple back and forth posts then]
Some info, I installed 3.2 via the installer and I don't think I chose a different path

RoyBatty01/05/2019
you'll have to delete everything manually then majin and reinstall

RoyBatty01/05/2019
the reason TTW can't install is because you messed up your data folder
reinstall the mods through mo2
there's nothing wrong with the alien blaster
you're using a mod that's breaking it

Cait11/06/2018
Pay attention to the /s

So the installer finally finished on 3..2, but when I run the installer for 3.2.1 it shows up like this.

sedme07/17/2019
So I figured out that these mpi files are actually bsa files, so since I can't use the installer to patch the mod normally, I'll have to do it manually. I extracted the 3.2.1 mpi and I'm guessing the .xd3 files are xdelta patches and the other files are just ready to be dropped in. I don't want to break anything, so can anyone confirm this?

Hi
The TTW installer is unreasonably slow

flecked08/14/2019
:snig~1:

Telavus08/14/2019
Seems like the ogg encoder threads dont utilize my pc fully

RoyBatty08/14/2019
and transcoding 50000 audio files is supposed to be sped up how?

Telavus08/14/2019
Im well aware my dude

RoyBatty08/14/2019
your PC is probably throttling due to poor cooling

Telavus08/14/2019
But its like 20 threads utilizing 1% of my cpu power
No its not


RoyBatty08/14/2019
what OS

Telavus08/14/2019
Cpu is at 50 degreea celsius
Latest linux kernel and latest wine staging

RoyBatty08/14/2019
install uses 90% of my CPU
problem is in wine

Telavus08/14/2019
I thought so.

RoyBatty08/14/2019
create a windows VM, run it in there

...


RoyBatty08/15/2019
problem is with linux or wine
probably wine
perhaps audio driver
it's working on windows and osx

Telavus08/15/2019
Audio driver?
Encoding vorbis has nothing to do with that

RoyBatty08/15/2019
bad audio drivers crash on windows, it's because of bass.dll
its in the FAQ

...

RoyBatty08/15/2019
we're using ogg2enc , it uses bass dll's, check the faq you can try deleting some


RoyBatty08/15/2019
main installer is written in object pascal, its compiled to native code so shouldn't be an issue and oggenc is all C++ afaik
well if whatever wine version you are using has poor multithread support
the installer takes about an hour for me,  Windows 7, i4790k
all threads used, CPU 90% usage

Telavus08/15/2019
What libs are the installer relying on
Maybe i could rewrite to linux

RoyBatty08/15/2019
Jam's machine is a monster with a xeon in it, takes her 45 mins
is SSE disabled in Wine ?

Telavus08/15/2019
Its not in PIO mode
its an nvme ssd
Bandwith should be plenty
How many files should the TTW mod folder consist of?

RoyBatty08/15/2019
with updates?

Telavus08/15/2019
Just pure install of latest version

RoyBatty08/15/2019
15.2 GB in 30 folders consisting of 288 files with updates. I don't have a count without.
2 less I guess
nope, 4 less

Telavus08/15/2019
My folder is 15GiB
so that sounds about right

RoyBatty08/15/2019
the updates dont take anywhere near as long









having some issues running the installer in wine. yes, it's slow as hell but i can live with that. my issue is actually that the installer craps out with "BASS Encode start error" about 1/3 of the way into the 3.2 install (~13hrs in for me). If I try skipping the ogg conversion using the -NoOggEnc2 from the batch file, it seems to do much better and the main 3.2 install completes. But then for the upgrade to 3.2.1 no matter how many times I close/reopen, I can't get past an error aboout Archive "C:\ttw\repack\Fallout - Meshes.bsa" doesn't exist for location: FNV Fallout - Meshes.bsa

I feel like I am so close to getting all the pieces together. I had FONV with 4gb-LLA-patch/NVSE/JIP LN working with Vortex befoe I reset to vanilla for the TTW install , I can extract BSAs on linux, and converting ogg to 24khz wav with ffmpeg should be pretty simple... so really I feel like my biggest roadblock is just running the installer itself.

Saw a comment from RoyBatty last month that the main install is written in object pascal. Anybody know of a way to dump the file contents of the *.mpi files? If I could just get the mod-specific stuff as a 7z/rar (TaleOfTwoWastelands.esm, TaleOfTwoWastelands*.bsa's, etc) then I'm pretty confident I could get the rest sorted out on my own. the faq even lists the steps more or less: https://taleoftwowastelands.com/faq#TTWInstaller
