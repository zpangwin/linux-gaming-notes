I'm not going to ask the devs for linux support but I HAVE used this under wine and the only "issues" I see are really just things that don't work for some Windows users (e.g. AMD cpus, MO2 users, etc). Maybe I could request them to do some things that would benefit EVERYONE - including windows users?

1) I have seen mention in a few places that the installer runs slowly on AMD cpus. Some (maybe most) of this is probably unavoidable, but if they are using ffmpeg under the covers maybe they could be convinced to add the -nostdin flag (assumng that it is not present already)? The flag shouldn't impact anything for input/output files but it can have a decent performance boost in some cases (not just on linux but for sure it would help there).

2) I have seen some users on the discord #general channel mention getting error messages when installing the update packages (TTW_v3.2.1_to_v3.2.2_Update especially) into a separate folder (e.g. not Fallout New Vegas\Data). This seems to be more frequent for Mod Organizer 2 users, probably because they're more likely to install to a separate folder. Not sure if this is the case, but if the original 3.2 does all the OGG re-encoding, then would it be possible to also offer the updates as simple 7z/rar archives that you could extract and copy into an existing TTW install? This seems like it would be a fairly simple ask and yet make a huge difference for linux users.

3) See if devs might be open to possibly sharing / open-sourcing the installer source code? On the windows side, that would potentially gain contributers / maintainers to help out (and of course you could still reject unsatifactory pull requests). On the linux side, it might give us insight into dependencies / fixes are needed for it to run smoothlyu in wine or help us figure out workarounds when we run into problems.

4) If there is no dev buy-in for #2 / #3, see if anyone knows how to extract/dump the contents of a .mip file.

====================================================================


7) In addition to the Vortex LOOT module, Vortex also covers the "ArchiveInvalidation Invalidated" stuff that you see in a lot of Bethesda games.

It is implemented as a plugin in Vortex; should be enabled by default but if you messed with them you might have to re-enable "Gambryo Archive Invalidation".

The setting is per-game so first activate the game you want to use (e.g. FO:NV) > then go to Dashboard > under the pane labeled "Let's Get You Set Up" there should be a big orange button labeled "Archive Invalidate: No" just click it once to toggle it to "Yes".

--------------------------------------------------------------------

8) TTW (Tales of Two Wastelands) ... this is a royal pain in the backside that will take a LONG TIME (potentially > 24 hrs) but is doable if you are patient.

---------------------------------
Before you start, you MUST have:
---------------------------------
- Legal, fully updated copies of FO3 + FONV installed (Steam and GOG ok - not sure about others)
- Have heard that TTW has issues with non-English language (untested)
- You'll need to run the TTW installer from the same wine prefix where the games are actually installed. I had initially tried to run in from a separate wine prefix with symlinks and the installer would always get stuck at around 25% (not just slow but no UI updates either). See
- both FO3 and FONV need to be in a VANILLA state. E.g.:
	- UNMODDED (undeploy and use 'Purge' button in Vortex)
	- NO FOSE/NVSE plugins (move to temp dirs)
	- exe's need to be UNPATCHED (restore the original, non-4gb patched exes)

	-> If you don't have backups, sucks to be you; you'll need to reinstall / recheck files in steam if you want to continue. I am a bit of a backup nazi (to the point of spending the time to put my GAME DIRs under version control in git and then using new branches for testing this out)
- You need to run both games once so that registry entries and INI files are generated in the wine prefix where the install will happen.

-------------------------------
Finding the right wine prefix:
-------------------------------
I used Lutris and find that to be the easiest. If you want to switch to it, you should be able to install Lutris and copy/move an existing Native Steam/Proton install to Lutris's wine steam dir, launch wine steam, and tell it to "install" the game (it will then find the local files). If you do this, make sure you run each game once before starting so that they generate their INI files and registry entries IN LUTRIS's WINEPREFIX.

By default, I think Lutris installs wine steam to 32- and 64-bit prefixes under:
	$HOME/.local/share/lutris/runners/bak_winesteam/
I moved mine to a bigger hard drive (in file explorer) then repointed Lutris to them: in Left-hand pane in Lutris > hover over "wine steam" and click the gear icon > edit the paths to match the new location.

If you really don't want to use Lutris and prefer to stay in native Steam/Proton, I did find this after I was almost done and you can maybe adapt my instructions to this Proton+Vortex guide: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1735078385

But if you want to run in proton, you'll have to figure out how to run the correct version of proton/whatever from the correct wineprefix for your game on your own.

---------------------------------------
Running commands from the wine prefix:
---------------------------------------
I'm showing commands from console for completeness. If you prefer to not deal with wine commands directly, then setup a game in Lutris first:
	- FO3: Add Game > fill out Name, Runner=Wine Steam, Application ID=22370 > OK
	- FONV: Add Game > fill out Name, Runner=Wine Steam, Application ID=22380 > OK

Then you can right click on the game in Lutris and choose:
	- Wine Console -> this is more or less the same as running 'wine cmd' which I will do a lot below

Vortex dirs:
	/gaming/lutris/vortex/drive_c/Vortex/falloutnv/mods

On my system /gaming/lutris is a symlink to a folder on a large 5 TB drive that I use almost exclusively for gaming and mods. It is formatted as ext4 and mounted in /etc/fstab with the options ' ext4  defaults,nofail,x-systemd.device-timeout=5s,nodev,user,exec 0 0'

---------------------------------------
TTW pre-install setup:
---------------------------------------
I made a temp folder at:
	/gaming/lutris/winesteam/prefix64/drive_c/ttw

then extracted contents of TTW_Install_v3.2_Full.7z and both update archives there.
	cd /gaming/lutris/winesteam/prefix64/drive_c/ttw
	ls
	 bass.dll         'TTW Install.exe'
	 bassenc.dll      'TTW Install Without OGG Reencoding.bat'
	 bassenc_mp3.dll   TTW_v3.2.1_to_v3.2.2_Update.mpi
	 bassenc_ogg.dll   TTW_v3.2_Full.mpi
	 bassmix.dll       TTW_v3.2_to_v3.2.1_Update.mpi
	 oggenc2.exe       xdelta3.dll

finally I made some empty folders for use DURING the install to store the mod's extracted files. I'll come back to these AFTER the install so I can copy their contents over to my Vortex mod dir.
	cd /gaming/lutris/winesteam/prefix64/drive_c/ttw
	mkdir repack/ update1/ update2/

---------------------------------------
Dealing with the TTW installer in wine:
---------------------------------------
I REALLY REALLY wish this was just a simple archive I could extract or a batch/vbs/ps1/py/etc file I could translate to equivalent unix commands. Unfortunately, I never found a way to do this. The files themselves are a combination of copying over your FO3 files and stuff stored in the mod's .mip files which according to the discord #general channel stands for 'mod install program' and appears to be some custom format. Renaming to 7z/ar/gz/rar/tar/xz/zip didn't allow extracting and I couldn't find much info about the format online.

I recommend watch what the install process looks like in Windows first. The Gamer Poets video for this is recommended from the official TTW site and is quite good:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHXIEGtP2Hw
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Y6wYEnNjM


Even though Mod Organizer 2 currently doesn't work under Linux/wine, we'll be doing a similar approach in the sense that we'll install to a separate folder (e.g. NOT Fallout New Vegas\Data). However, this video does not cover the TTW update files which is where I ran into most of the trouble.

There are several posts online about TTW working under Linux but all seemed to either:
a) rely on an actual Windows install/VM (e.g. not strictly wine/nix) to get past the installer:
	https://taleoftwowastelands.com/viewtopic.php?t=1703
	https://taleoftwowastelands.com/viewtopic.php?t=1960

b) did not cover the update modules:
	https://portingteam.com/files/file/3047-a-tale-of-two-wastelands-fallout-3-goty/page__st__165

c) were quite dated


Main issues with the installer under wine:
------------------------------------------
1. You need to run an OGG re-encoding routine to prevent stutter (this is part of default install). It takes forever; especially if you have an AMD cpu like me. Technically, there is an option (see bat file) for skipping this but when I tried that it ended up that the installer would not let me install the update packages because it thought there were missing files.

2. The installer's UI got messed up for me when running it in wine. Specifically, labels and buttons disappeared. I recommend checking out the Gamer Poet's video around times 2:00-2:10 to see what the UI looks like under Windows. By the way, the "Browse" dialog didn't work for me at all so I had to type things out by hand.

Basically, there are 2 "button links" for "Install" and "Exit" which are not initially visible when running from wine. However, they will show up as ugly green boxes with no text if you hover your mouse over the area. There will be 2 of them: "Install" is the box on the left and "Exit" is the box on the right. If you hit "Exit" accidentally, just re-launch.

There are also 3 labels with 3 textboxes that change depending on WHAT you are installing.
The last label/textbox will always be for the install/output folder.

If you are installing the main (v3.2) part of the mod, then the first 2 fields will be the same as in the video:
- Fallout 3 game install folder
- Fallout NV game install folder

If you are installing one of the update files (3.2.1 or 3.2.2), then the first 2 fields will be:
- Fallout NV game install folder
- TTW folder

3. From the discord channel, it sounded like even Windows users had some trouble installing the mod upgrades when they were installing to a separate folder (e.g. NOT Fallout New Vegas\Data) as shown for Mod Organizer in the Video. The recommendations there were to close and relaunch the app and to run as Admin.

https://askubuntu.com/a/892182
"As far as Windows programs are concerned, Wine runs with Windows administrator rights by default when it is started by an user with ordinary permissions (not root permissions)" - karel

As far as relaunching the app, that did get rid of one of the errrors I was seeing.

ERROR #1:
"Could not find Tale of Two Wasteland files at the specified path."

ERROR #2:
Archive "C:\ttw\repack\Fallout - Meshes.bsa" doesn't exist for location: FNV Fallout - Meshes.bsa



You will always have 3 but first 2 targets and will change depending

=> 3495-2400=1095 (Sep16@1045)


---------------------------------------
Moving captured files to Vortex:
---------------------------------------

The last bit of preparation is that I want to create a mod folder in Vortex where I can copy the files to AFTER the install completes. Initially, I just did this with a dummy file and then t

then made an empty folder to install TTW to (so I can repack it for Vortex later)
mkdir /gaming/lutris/winesteam/prefix64/drive_c/ttw/repack




-----------
CHOICE #1:
-----------
A) RECOMMENDED:
   You plan to install TTW in Vortex and let it link the TTW files into your GAME DIR.
-> In this case, change the output folder to something outside your GAME DIR.

	in my example above, this is "/gaming/lutris/winesteam/prefix64/drive_c/ttw/repack"
	but it can be pretty much any empty folder you create under the drive_c/
	you'll see this again in a bit but using windows notation (C:\ttw\repack)

Pros:
- Vortex should be able to manage conflicts
- Shouldn't be any issue with you using other mods (assuming they are otherwise compatible)
- Uninstall/reinstall should be simple.

Cons:
- Little more work up front
- Little more work if updates come out and you want to install them

B) You plan to install TTW directly into your GAME DIR and not manage it in Vortex.
-> In this case, leave output folder as default

Pros:
- You can be lazy initial (pre-populated box and no extra steps)
- You can be lazy when there are updates too.

Cons:
- Vortex probably won't be able to overwrite somethings since they already exist in the Data dir (unverified) so you might not be able to install other mods if they conflict.
- Harder to uninstall

-----------
EITHER WAY:
-----------
next start up wine cmd and change to the directory with the installer:
	env WINEPREFIX="/gaming/lutris/winesteam/prefix64" wine cmd
	cd /d "C:\ttw\"

-----------
CHOICE #2:
-----------
Do you want to re-encode the OGG audio files to try to reduce stuttering? I would generally recommend doing so unless either you don't care at all, you don't want to wait, you plan on doing so with another utility like ffmpeg, or you've already tried and failed to re-encode the OGG files and are willing to settle for just getting the darn thing running.

A) RECOMMENDED: re-encodes OGG files to reduce stutter; "run overnight while you sleep" speed. from wine cmd, run:
		"TTW Install.exe"

==OR==

B) skip OGG re-encoding; "go out and have dinner" speed. from wine cmd, run:
	"TTW Install.exe" -NoOggEnc2

-----------
EITHER WAY:
-----------
If you have the update files in the right folder, the TTW installer will first
prompt you to choose between the updates or the main file. Choose "TTW_v3.2_Full"
from the prompt the first time through; you'll have to rerun the app when you're
all done for each of the updates in order (the updates can be installed to the same output folder as the main file).


If you are running on the same wineprefix where the games live and have run the
games at least once, then the TTW installer should auto-detect the install paths
from the reigstry and pre-populate them for you.

Next file in the output folder (see choice #1 above). Assuming you went with the
recommendation then you would enter something like C:\ttw\repack.

Now, you've probably noticed that there aren't any continue/ok/next/etc buttons.
There actually are; but there is a graphical bug that is making them invisible.
Move your mouse pointer around in the area below and to the right of the output
textbox. You should see 2 green rectangular regions: these are both buttons.
The button on the left is the Install button and the button on the right is the Cancel
button. If you get it wrong, just re-launch the app and try again.

When you're all done, you can either click the button on the right or just close the window via the taskbar/etc.

Now close and re-open the app (if you see some output stil on win cmd, just hit hit
and the prompt should come back up. then press up arrow and enter to rerun last command)

When it re-launches, select "TTW_v3.2_to_v3.2.1_Update" this time. If the color for the
labels is messed up for you too, then you might not immediately notice but the text boxes
will have changed

from:
[Fallout 3 path]
[Fallout NV path]
[output dir]

to:
[Fallout NV path]
[TTW 3.2 install path]
[output dir]

At this point, I was getting errors when I tried to install the update into the output dir. First:
"Could not find Tale of Two Wasteland files at the specified path."

Then after reading the author's notes on discord channel (see https://discord.gg/zg46A6H > #general > RoyBatty on 07/26/2019), I saw that this happens on Windows when folks are doing it for Mod Organizer too. The solution there was to restart the app a few times and try running it as admin.

Reopening / re-enterinf path got rid of that error and then kept getting:
Archive "C:\ttw\repack\Fallout - Meshes.bsa" doesn't exist for location: FNV Fallout - Meshes.bsa

My plan to try and get by this was to take the base update and set it up in Vortex, then have Vortex deploy (hard-link) the TTW 3.2 into the game folder and try rerunning. If it worked, then I would send the update to C:\ttw\update1 then apply it on top of my Vortex mod folder.

create a dummy archive for Vortex so we can install a "Mod" with the right name
note: Vortex doesn't seem to install tar files right so I used zip instead
	mkdir Data;
	echo 'deleteme' > Data/dummy.txt;
	zip -r "TTW-Tales-of-Two-Wastes-3.2.zip" Data

Drag and drop "TTW-Tales-of-Two-Wastes-3.2.zip" into Vortex > Downloads > Drag section
then "install" it, go back to the filesystem explorer (nemo/nautilus/dolphin/etc) and
copy the contents of "/gaming/lutris/winesteam/prefix64/drive_c/ttw/repack" to the Vortex mod folder. Finally go back to Vortex, enable the TTW mod and deploy it.

My New Vegas GAME DIR now has 'TaleOfTwoWastelands.esm' (among lots of other files) that
are hard-linked from Vortex.

Then I tried loading the utility again with "TTW_v3.2_to_v3.2.1_Update"

[Fallout NV path]	== "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout New Vegas"
[TTW 3.2 install path] == "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout New Vegas\Data"
[output dir] == "C:\ttw\update1";

--> Nope; still blocked by that freaking archive...








Then repeat everything one last time for "TTW_v3.2.1_to_v3.2.2_Update".

Finally, assuming that you chose the recommended option for CHOICE #1 (Vortex managed mod) then you should have something equivalent to my /gaming/lutris/winesteam/prefix64/drive_c/ttw/repack folder which contains the files for the main mod, with update 1 and the update 2 overlayed on top of those files.

Now repack it and feed it to Vortex:
mv "/gaming/lutris/winesteam/prefix64/drive_c/ttw/repack" "/gaming/lutris/winesteam/prefix64/drive_c/ttw/Data"
tar -zcvf "TTW-Tales-of-Two-Wastes-3.2+Updates.tar" "/gaming/lutris/winesteam/prefix64/drive_c/ttw/Data"



tar -zcvf "TTW-Tales-of-Two-Wastes-3.2+Updates.tar" "/gaming/lutris/winesteam/prefix64/drive_c/ttw/repack"



sudo apt install -y p7zip-full;

7z a -t7z -m0=lzma2 -mx=9 -md=32m -ms=on "${zipPath}" "${dirPath}"












I did this with:
Fallout 3 GOTY (Steam version installed under Steamwine in Lutris)
Fallout NV GOTY (ditto)

per https://taleoftwowastelands.com/dl

First I partially followed this:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cypqage_Pdk

- First, I realize the video says you can skip most of this for TTW. You probably can. But I had already done most of it and am trying to document exactly what I di to the best of my memory. You're welcome to slim it down and re-verify that it still works under Linux/wine :-)

- I ignored everything mentioning Mod Organizer or NMM (for the reasons mentioned in previous post).

- he is using the same 4GB patcher I mentioned earlier; only difference is that I ran it from a separate 32-bit wine prefix (you could probably reuse a steamwine / proton wineprefix but i choose not to so as to avoid messing anything up)

- I did the same stuff for NVSE, NVAC, Vorbis, JIP, and NVSR. I also installed the NVSE Plugins not mentioned in the video: UI Organizer (UIO), lStewieAl's Tweaks, and the optional DisableProcessWindowsGhosting file from NVAC download page; you don't need the extra stuff - just listing them for completeness.

- Added config as noted in video: ./Fallout New Vegas/Data/NVSE/NVSE_Config.ini
	[Memory]
	DefaultHeapInitialAllocMB=400

- Modified config as noted in video: ./Fallout New Vegas/Data/NVSE/Plugins/sr_New_Vegas_Stutter_Remover.ini -- not sure if these are really needed; you might be able to use the default values. I just used what was in the video because I didn't feel like testing.

- I used the default configs except as noted in the video for NVSE

- I skipped the ENB section entirely. Partially because I never used them on windows, partially bc I have no clue how to set them up under nix, and partially bc I am not sure I wanted to risk any instability from them right now.

 - for the Fallout.ini section, I applied the bSelectivePurgeUnusedOnFastTravel=1 and bPreemptivelyUnloadCells=1 settings, skipped the CPU/Core/Thread settings bc I wasn't sure if this would work well in wine, and then applied both audio cache settings.

 - In wine steam, I disabled steam overlay for FO3 and FONV

 - I had previously tried the BSA decompressor under a 32-bit wine prefix and saw that it crashed whenever i tried to browse folders. maybe it would work under different wine settings but i just decided to skip it. //update: tried again. if you mess with the Browse button, you just need to kill and restart the app then manually type the path without clicking Browse and it should work. Anyway, I skipped it so I would consider it a bonus step.

 - TESTED SETUP TO MAKE SURE I COULD LOAD GAME WITHOUT CRASHING
 I was able to open the game and load up a save from just after chargen. then ~ to open console and typed "GetNVSEVersion" (without the quotes - also its not case-sensitive) as a test to confirm that NVSE loaded at least. I got: "NVSE Version: 5"


 Then move on to video #2
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHXIEGtP2Hw

 - Again, ignore the stuff about Mod Organize because it doesn't (currently) work that great under wine/Linux.

 - Before you get started, if you already patched either or both FO3 / FONV exes, then you will need to temporariliy revert to the original unpatched exe to get past the install (hope you kept backups! if not, sorry but winehq doesn't let me edit my posts to note that in the beginning - you may have to have steam check files)

 - For best Vortex compatibility, create a dir for the install, do the install, then repack as a 7z and install the 7z in Vortex like you would any other mod.

 mkdir -p "./Fallout New Vegas/Repack/TTW - A Tale of Two Wastelands"

- Download the main installer AND update files from the TTW site. Extract the TTW_Install_v3.2_Full.7z and the update achives into a temp folder under a wineprefix.
I just re-used my temporary 32-bit wineprefix where I did the 4gb patching / bsa stuff earlier and made a symlink:

	./drive_c$ ln -s '/gaming/lutris/winesteam/prefix64/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Steam'/ Steam

- Around the 1:45 mark in the video, he mentions that the install can be done with or without OGG re-encoding. You only have to run the exe version if you want to do the OGG re-encode; otherwise you can use the batch file (which just calls "TTW Install.exe" -NoOggEnc2). It's also mentioned that it needs registry keys (you dont... if you were lazy and symlinked it like me, just manually type in the paths)

We need to run this from wine. I used the -NoOggEnc2 flag; if I need it later I can probably rerun or possibly even re-encode with ffmpeg:

	env WINEPREFIX="/path/to/new/32bit/wine/pfx" wine cmd
	cd /d "C:\ttw\TTW_Install_v3.2_Full\"
	"TTW Install.exe" -NoOggEnc2

	# based on my earlier symlink setup, i entered the following
	# as with the bsa stuff earlier, the Browse button does NOT work.
	# copy/paste is also broke so you have to type it out...
	# so be careful to review/check spelling and make sure output dir exists

	C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty
	C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout New Vegas
	C:\ttw\repack

	Once it starts, it will take awhile. it might look like it has frozen.
	hopefully thats not the case. for me the fonts in the progress bar blurred
	the text together and made it unreadable.
	 take a few minutes to extract (2:16 to)
