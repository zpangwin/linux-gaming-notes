    # Path notes:
    #   My steam dir is /gaming/steam
    #   Default one is ~/.steam/steam or ~/.local/share/Steam
    <steamapps>=under your steam install (/gaming/steam/steamapps)
    <gamedir>=game install (<steamapps>/common/Risen 2)
    <pfxdir>=proton 'pfx' folder (<steamapps>/compatdata/40390/pfx)
    <winegamedir>=Fake quasi-windows path used by wine and game process (Z:/gaming/steam/steamapps/common/Risen 2). either type of slash works but you have to escape backslash in double-quotes so unix forward slash is easier.

1. Deleted <pfxdir> then verified install from steam
2. Relaunched game. didnt start but it recreated <pfxdir>
3. Checked reg values with $ grep -Pi 'Piranha|Risen|Silver' *.reg
	system.reg:[Software\\Wow6432Node\\deep silver\\risen2] 1614477338
	system.reg:"exe_path"="\\system\\risen2.exe"

	$ grep 'deep silver' -A 5
		[Software\\Wow6432Node\\deep silver\\risen2] <random int>
		#time=<random hexstring>
	 	"exe_path"="\\system\\risen2.exe"
		"install_path"=""
		"language"=dword:00000001
		"version"="0.95"

	-> no changes made at this time; just noting values and paths
	-> may try changing the 'exe_path' path later but doubt thats it

4. Added debug params to launch options:
	`PROTON_LOG=1 PROTON_LOG_DIR=~/Desktop PROTON_DUMP_DEBUG_COMMANDS=1 %command%`
	then relaunched game and then `xed ~/Desktop/steam-40390.log`

	there are a bunch of lines with "loaddll:build_module Loaded" then
	17558.901:00cc:00d0:trace:loaddll:build_module Loaded L"C:\\windows\\system32\\OLEAUT32.dll" at 6A300000: builtin
		-> last successful dll that was loaded
	
	17558.901:00cc:00d0:err:module:LdrInitializeThunk Importing dlls for L"Z:\\gaming\\steam\\steamapps\\common\\Risen 2\\system\\Risen2.exe" failed, status c0000135
		-> some unknown dll failed to load and things crapped out
		-> cant tell which one it is but shouldnt be any of the ones listed above

5. When I launch, it always seems to take awhile before it craps out.
	Makes me wonder if its trying to install some shit like reinstalling game
	dependencies. reminds me of another workaround i saw for something else.
	going to try an [ME3 workaround](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/3999#issuecomment-748336039) on this game.
5.1. Close out of steam
5.2. run terminal:
		# run the physx redistrib included with game:
		PROTONWINE="<steamapps>/common/Proton 5.13/dist/bin/wine64"
		WINEPREFIX="<pfxdir>" "$PROTONWINE" start /D"<winegamedir>/redist/PhysX" PhysX_SystemSoftware.exe
		
		# one-liner of above command
		# e.g. WINEPREFIX="/gaming/steam/steamapps/compatdata/40390/pfx" "/gaming/steam/steamapps/common/Proton 5.13/dist/bin/wine64" start /D"Z:/gaming/steam/steamapps/common/Risen 2/redist/PhysX" PhysX_SystemSoftware.exe
		
		# confirm install was successful
		# should see a non-zero # of dll files that were
		# installed under drive_c/Program Files (x86)/
		find "drive_c/Program Files (x86)"/ -type f -iname '*physx*.dll'|wc -l
		
		# and be able to see them added to Wine's Windows PATH variable
		grep 'Session Manager\\\\Environment' system.reg -A 20|grep '"PATH"='|grep -i phys

		# now prevent steam from fucking stuff up:
		# chattr -i: file cannot be modified, deleted or renamed except by root
		cd "<pfxdir>"
		sudo chattr +i *.reg
		# note: if you read the ME3 bug he blocks stuff under syswow64. on my
		# install there were no dll files there or under system32. they were
		# instead located under the program files x86 dir with PATH variable
		# set as shown above during verification steps. SO i am going to skip
		# all the "syswow64" stuff he did bc it be worthless in my install
		# 
		# but i will make "drive_c/Program Files (x86)/NVIDIA Corporation"
		# folder more tamper-proof than he did.
		#
		cd "drive_c/Program Files (x86)"
		chmod -R a-w "NVIDIA Corporation"
		sudo chattr -R +i "NVIDIA Corporation"

	-> Restart Steam and relaunch
	-> launch dialog said installing directx, ms visual c++ runtime, then physx
	-> then game process was launched (confirmed via pgrep) but no visual and
		then process exited on its own

		-> need directx / visual c++?
		-> some other issue?
6. Deleted <pfxdir> then relaunched game to recreate it
7.

10. nothing so far... looking at thel og from last failed launch, I see;:
