if i get it going, check other games that are borked due to physx:

Homefront 1:
https://www.protondb.com/app/55100
-> still borked as of 2021-feb-27

Mass Effect 3 N7 Digital Deluxe Edition
https://www.protondb.com/app/1238020
-> ~9months ago (~ May 2020) lot of stuff about it not working due to physx
-> first person to get it working was using Proton-5.11-GE-1-MF but others claimed this didn't work
-> 2ns to get it working: Used 32bit prefix with winesteam (lutris 5.7), worked without any problem that way.
-> https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/3999#issuecomment-748336039
	-> Every time you hit play on Steam, it runs the "First time setup" which deletes a lot of files and some registry keys.
	-> let the game do its first time setup and complete then close out of everything (including steam)
	-> run the physx redistrib included with game:
		WINEPREFIX="/path/to/game/prefix" wine start /D"C:/relative/path/from/pfx" "PhysX_9.09.0814_SystemSoftware.exe"
	-> then prevent steam from fucking stuff up:
		in terminal:
			cd "/path/to/game/prefix"
			sudo chattr +i *.reg
			cd drive_c/windows/syswow64
			sudo chattr +i PhysX*
			sudo chattr +i AGEIA/
			sudo chattr +i AgC*
			cd AGEIA/
			chmod 555 *
			cd ../../..
			cd "ProgramFiles(x86)"
			chmod -R 555 "NVIDIA Corporation"
			chmod -R 555 "AGEIA Tecnologies
	-> Restart Steam and hit play! Should work perfectly every time!

Bionic Commando: Rearmed
https://www.protondb.com/app/21680
-> initial comments about physx. e.g. "Boots to splash screen then immediately closes" / "PhysX runtime error"
-> "Wont start without physx. Works flawless after installing physx with winetricks"

======================================================================================================================
Could there be a bad registry path like what happened in the
beyond good and evil steam install?

	go to steam\steamapps\common\Risen\data\ini
	and open the configdefault with notepat or press edit(right click etc)
	then change fullscreen "true" to fullscreen "false" save then open the game if works start new game and save then exit redo the full screen to true thens tart game from steam app :) hope it works

https://steamcommunity.com/app/40390/discussions/0/2381701715725096834/

	This is what worked for me:
	Go to: .\Steam\steamapps\common\Risen 2\data\ini\
	Open "ConfigDefault.xml" with texteditor of your choice (e.g. Notepad)
	Search for (Shortcut: CTRL + F): "refreshrate"
	In my ConfigDefault.xml this value was "0"
	I changed it to "60" and saved it.

	Started the game and finally saw the main menu :-)

	(original was in french)

	4-once the download is finished, the game will still not work, because the 'PhysXLoader.dll' file will be missing, and an error message will tell you ...
	5-download this file on the internet (google search)
	6-copy the file 'PhysXLoader.dll' in the directory of Windows / System32 AND in Windows / Sys WOW64
	7-installer 'PhysX-9.13.0604-SystemSoftware-Legacy' (google search by copy / paste)
	8-installer 'NVIDIA PhysX 9.16.0318 system software '(google search by copy / paste)
	9-check (in programs and functionalities) that these two software are installed:
		'visual microsoft C ++ 2005 redistributable (x64) '
		'visual microsoft C ++ 2005 redistributable'

https://steamcommunity.com/app/40390/discussions/0/215439774865498331/

	What fixed it for me was changing the AdapterNumber in data\ini\ConfigDefault.xml from 0 to 1, as #0 is apparently my WMR set, that the game was trying to get displayed on. You might have to change it from 1 to 0, depending on what count the game assigns to your displays.

	You might also have to do the same in %localappdata%\Risen2\Config\ConfigUser.xml

https://steamcommunity.com/app/40300/discussions/0/46476691571092149/

	I've managed to fix this opening the ConfigDefault.xml archive, which is located at C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\common\Risen\data\ini

	You have to search "physics" while using the notepad and write Disabled="true"

https://steamcommunity.com/app/40300/discussions/0/46476691571092149/?ctp=2

	I found a other way to fix the blackscreen (without any error-message) and Fatal-error (Physx).
	Found some good propositions on the web.

	I use Windows 8.1 and Nvidia GTX 960 and the fix worked without reinstalling the game. My problem was the blackcreen after the Risen-logo. I had to shut it manually down and there was no error-message.

	Here's the Fix for the blackscreen:
		1. Go to the following folder: D:\Program Files\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\Risen\data\ini
		2. Open "ConfigDefault.xml"
		3. Search for the the following line:	--- FullScreen="true"
		4. Change "true" to "false"				--- FullScreen="false"
		5. Save the changes and start the game.
			--- Risen will start in a window. Go to the settings (ingame) and change your Video
			--- Settings back to fullscreen!!! Dont forget to set your preffered resolution and it's done
			--- The game will start normally now and always in Fullscreen. You woun't have to do this
			--- steps again. Don't know why... But it was the first thinbg I tried and it's working.

	Aftter fixing the Blackscreen I got the Fatal-Error-Message (Physx).
		1. Just install Physx.
			--- Visit the nvidia.com and download the newest version of Physx and install it.
			http://www.nvidia.com/object/physx-9.13.1220-driver.html

		It's done! The game will start without blackscreen and without the Physx Error!

	run a game that is giving problem's and check the kernel output after closing it for any error's or indication of a hidden background problem (use command "journalctl -b --output short-monotonic")

	- Check that - "visual microsoft C ++ 2005 redistributable (x64)" / "visual microsoft C ++ 2005 redistributable" - are installed.

	- Also, check the installation of the "Nvidia-PhysX" program :

https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Risen_2:_Dark_Waters

	-> has some good tech details about config files and such
	-> might be good for verifying stuff wasn't messed up during install

	-> also has "Risen 2 Fails to Launch / Hangs on launch"
		-> PhysX
		-> Verify install

	-> "Game doesn't start / Frequency out of range errored
		-> option 1: delete %LOCALAPPDATA%\Risen2\Config\ConfigUser.xml (new one gets created next time game is stared)
		-> option 2: edit <path-to-game>\data\ini\ConfigDefault.xml
			In the section <Window>, you should verify that the values are correct:
				AdapterNumber="0"
				Top="0"
				Bottom="768"
				Left="0"
				Right="1024
				RefreshRate="85"

	-> "Game uses the wrong monitor"
		-> Set monitor in %LOCALAPPDATA%\Risen2\Config\ConfigUser.xml
		-> Set monitor in <Steam-folder>/steamapps/compatdata/40390/pfx/Users/steamuser/LocalAppData/Risen2/Config/ConfigUser.xml
			Change the AdapterNumber line so it reads AdapterNumber="0"
			Save your changes and test the result in-game.

	How do I enable the HUD?

	In your Steam Library/steamapps/common/Proton 3.x rename user settings example to user_settings.py open it in a text editor and remove the # at the beginning of the DXVK_HUD line

	Alternatively you can add it to the steam launch options

		DXVK_HUD=fps %command%

taskset [options] mask command [argument...]
taskset [options] -p [mask] pid

taskset  is  used  to  set  or  retrieve  the CPU affinity of a running
process given its pid, or to launch a new  command  with  a  given  CPU
affinity.   CPU affinity is a scheduler property that "bonds" a process
to a given set of CPUs on the system.  The Linux scheduler  will  honor
the  given CPU affinity and the process will not run on any other CPUs.
Note that the Linux scheduler also supports natural CPU  affinity:  the
scheduler attempts to keep processes on the same CPU as long as practi?
cal for performance reasons.  Therefore, forcing a specific CPU  affin?
ity is useful only in certain applications.

The CPU affinity is represented as a bitmask, with the lowest order bit
corresponding to the first logical CPU and the highest order bit corre?
sponding  to  the  last logical CPU.  Not all CPUs may exist on a given
system but a mask may specify more CPUs than are present.  A  retrieved
mask  will  reflect only the bits that correspond to CPUs physically on
the system.  If an invalid mask is given (i.e., one that corresponds to
no  valid  CPUs on the current system) an error is returned.  The masks
may be specified in hexadecimal (with or without a leading "0x"), or as
a CPU list with the --cpu-list option.  For example,

   0x00000001  is processor #0,

   0x00000003  is processors #0 and #1,

   0xFFFFFFFF  is processors #0 through #31,

   32          is processors #1, #4, and #5,

   --cpu-list 0-2,6
               is processors #0, #1, #2, and #6.

When  taskset returns, it is guaranteed that the given program has been
scheduled to a legal CPU.

	Launcher:Steam
	Launch Flags:Use D9VK

	Used WINETRICKS as discussed to fix AUDIO and copied/pasted into the game Launch Options the following from this page: PROTON_FORCE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE=1 PROTON_USE_D9VK=1 taskset --cpu-list 0-7 %command%

	R9-3900x CPU (12-core) so I guess that was the final problem why it kept crashing "Slyxxx" here had that fix as anything above 8 cores crashes otherwise.

	Will try the res fix but it looks great already at 1920x1080 (2560x1440 monitor), 4xAA. Also runs SMOOTH unlike on Windows 10 for me where it has an odd JUDDER (quick stutter) which is why I kept trying to make it work in Linux.

	So there's the AUDIO fix via Winetricks, appyling Vulkan API, CPU fix for high core-count systems and if desired the DLL replacement if you have more than 1920x1080 res.
