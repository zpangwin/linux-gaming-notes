## Reverse Lookup by Ingredient

For easy lookup to see if an ingredient can be used for anything you might be interested in later.

As a reminder, the gun names in this game make no sense whatsoever: it has guns with "Shotgun" in their name that use either the Pistols, Shotguns, or Muskets skill. It also has guns with "Rifle" in their name that use either Muskets or Shotguns skills. Either the guys doing the gun names have never played a FPS before or they were blazed off his ass when setup the names...
