Detailed Comparison:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Playthrough 1:

* Didn't beat up anyone on Caldera for extra Glory
* Never knew about the possibility of getting a free The Twins Pistol on Caldera
* Tacarigua: beat up roqueford during training and riley for bandana. then left patty near tower then stole from chest in de fugio's mansion to agro guards and kited them back to her where i eventually beat them up for extra glory.
* Had gotten all of Largo's clothes before I freed him so didn't want to turn in Blackpearl
* I got the bonesaw very early on (killed a few warthogs first but that was it). Killed all wildlife before leaving Tacarigua, even passive stuff, grave spider, and ancestor. Only exception was I had missed the cave near the plantation.
* Tacarigua: Looted everything that wasn't tied down / had low enough lockpicking requirements
* Sword Coast: Had gone around with Patty clearing things out before visiting Puerto Isabella and again after getting the skinning knife. Cleared out probably 3/4 or better of the island before I ever visited the Natives Village for the first time.
* Sword Coast: Beat up pretty much every named character in and around Puero Isabella (including Isabella). The only exceptions being Alveraz? bc he had 4 guards nearby and the people on the ship bc I was also drastically outnumbered there. Also beat up pretty much every named character in the native village (pirates and villagers). All for the extra, zero-penalty glory.
* Sided with Natives

* Sword Coast:

Playthrough 2:

* Caldera: Got free The Twins Pistol from Sebastiano on Caldera (must be done before rescuing Patty)

* Caldera: Beat up Severin/Storeroom Master/Carlos/Juan/Angus/Sebastiano/Bosun/2 Sailors for penalty-free glory. This took me many many reloads and was a right pain in the ass.

* Tacarigua Puerto Sacarico: For more penalty-free glory, I beat up the 3 defenseless ship-slaves. Then the guard at the town entrance. Then Roquefort and Pedro. Then "The Helmsman". Then the first plantation slave on the right. Then Osorio. And Vasco/Ghilles/Thompson. The Guard outside the slavehouse after midnight (should be the guard furtherest from the shack at the plantation) and all the slaves. De Fuego and his 3 guards. Barracks guard. Riley. The other unnamed Plantation guard. And finally, Carter, the jail guard.

* Tacarigua Pirates Den: For more penalty-free glory, I beat up Colby/Barney/Flannigan/Lola/Alister/Elia/Curtis/Morris/Hank/Holly/Booze/O'Brian/Foster/Doggs and the 2 unnamed pirates in the bar. Then also Stone and the 2 nearby unnamed Pirates. And Fence and the unnamed pirate guarding the gate. And Jack at the Lighthouse.

* Tacarigua Creatures: I still made a beeline to the bonesaw and got that pretty much before i killed any wildlife. But this time around, animals with skins (warthogs, jaguars, panthers) I tried to avoid them as much as possible this time around so as to be able to reap in some cash later. Animals with only one or two minor things that I would have missed (like not getting teeth for claw monkeys; not getting eyes for giant crabs/grave spiders), I didn't worry about and killed all of those that I could get to without triggering fights for skinnable animals.

	Grave Spider: could get 1 eye if you wait
	Warthogs: could get up to 1 tusk and 1 skin per hog if you want
	jaguars: could get 1 skin and 1 heart per kitty if you wait
	claw monkeys: can get 1 claw now. could get 1 teeth per monkey if you wait
	giant crabs: can get 1 oyster now. could get 1 eye per crab if you wait
	sand devil: can get everything now, no need to wait
	ghouls: can get 1 claw now. could get ??? if you wait

->	You miss out on the rum quest if you don't take care of the termites (might be required for joining steelbeard's crew?). Anyways, you wont be losing too much if you only do that one cave

-> Eyes you can get from Crabs & Spiders. Doesn't hurt to leave some but there should be plenty later.

-> Jaguar Heart can only come from Jaguars which are pretty rare. Can also be skinned later. Avoid these as much as possible. If you have to kill one, there will be more but more pelts later == more cash later.

-> Monkey Skull: these onyl come from the passive monkeys. easy to leave alone for now and not much xp gain so good to leave unless you're really desperate for every ounce of xp.

-> Teeth: you can get these from claw monkeys. you can leave from to get extra teeth later if you want but if you wanna kill a few, there are plenty of claw monkeys on other islands and you can get a Tribal Symbol for free on Tacarigua (in river stream west and north of lighthouse, near the falls). this decision should be a mostly: delay xp for bigger monetary gain vs quick xp (you'll have plenty of funds later too).

-> Tusk: come from warthogs. warthogs also can be skinned later. again xp vs gold but you probably stand to gain a bit more gold here than with the monkeys. that said, there are plenty of these on other islands also.

* Did a small cheat: gave large back his stuff, then re-added his boots, bandana, and blackpearl back to my inventory. i'd be a liar if i said i wasn't interested in the gold and xp but just having the quest cleared out was also a big factor for me. Not intending to do any big cheating but don't like either or quests...
