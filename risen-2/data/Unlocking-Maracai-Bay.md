## To Unlock the Island:

There are several options for unlocking navigation to Maracai Bay. They most depend on if you took the Voodoo path or not and if so, how much gold you want to avoid spending vs wanting to be able to get a lot of loot to recoup the expenses.

* Option 1) The non-Voodoo route: This can be done whether you sided with the Inquisition or with the Natives. While there are some gold costs that are required to complete the quest, you can recoup these costs somewhat by looting the Council Building (assuming you have some lockpicking skill). This option also awards the most XP.

* Option 2) The pure-Voodoo route: This can only be done if you sided with the Natives and learned voodoo. You will also need certain voodoo components as listed below. This option allows you to avoid the gold expenses of the quest but in turn you can only loot a few things from the Council Building because your possessed target cannot pick locks. This option does not award much XP by itself.

* Option 3) The hybrid route: This can only be done if you sided with the Natives and learned voodoo. You will also need certain voodoo components as listed below. This option allows you to avoid half of the gold costs but still allows looting the Council Building (again, assuming you have some lockpicking skills). It awards the same amount of XP as Option 1.


## Prerequisites:

 * Option 1) The non-Voodoo route: Faction choice doesn't matter but you will need a total of 1000 gold to spend during the quest (You can recoup 250 g of this at the end of the quest via a dialog choice with Azuro. You can also offset some of the cost via looting. But you will still need 1000 g to start with)

 * Option 2) The pure-Voodoo route: only available if you joined the Native Faction, as you will need to create a voodoo doll. Requires: 1x Jade, 1x Eye, 1x Voodoo Doll, 1x Teeth, Mauregato's Claim Ticket (from the 1st floor study in his house), and (100 gold OR Pickpocket 75).

 * Option 3) The hybrid route: only available if you joined the Native Faction, as you will need to create a voodoo doll. Requres: 1x Jade, 1x Eye, 1x Voodoo Doll, 1x Teeth, Mauregato's Claim Ticket (from the 1st floor study in his house), (600 gold OR (500 gold and Pickpocket 75))


## Steps

### Option 1: The non-Voodoo route

Pros: You can loot the Council Building, bigger XP reward than Option 2
Cons: You need to spend a lot of gold (1000g) to complete the quest

1. Complete the initial story arc about Crow (Caldera I -> Tacarigua -> Sword Coast)
2. Steal a ship.
3. Return to Caldera and talk to Commandant Carlos. He will give permission to open the gate to the city. Then talk to the gate gaurd to open the gate
4. Cross the bridge and enter the first house on the left (Mauregato's). To get in, you can either: a) just select dialog normally, b) use Silver Tongue 55, or c) just kick the guard's ass (and the servant's) and enter anyway.
5. Talk to Mauregato. He'll act suspicious, clam up and refuse to talk to you. That's normal; don't worry about it.
6. Before you leave his house, you may want to grab a few things to avoid extra trips later. You'll either need to sneak or else have given the servant and guard the beat down so that they'll bugger off and stay out of your way. On the first floor, to the right of the entrance is a study. You'll find a Key and a Claim Ticket in that room; grab both of those. Once you have the key, go upstairs and opened the locked door to his bedroom. Grab the Signet Ring from the night stand in there.
7. Leave Mauregato and go back to the bridge. From there, go straight (it should be slightly uphill) and all the way to the back should be some stairs into a building with a guard on duty. This is the Council Building. Talk to the guard and he'll tell you to piss off.
8. Talk to the street vendor Possodino and exhaust dialog options. Then go into the nearby Hotel and talk to the hostess (Lucia) and the clothing Merchant (Pantaleo) and exhaust all the options about Garcia (note: you do *not* have to rent his old room for this). Return to the street just outside the Council Building. You should be approached by "a servant" who asks you to meet with his master. Follow him back to Azuro's house then go upstairs, talk to Azuro, and agree to help.
9. You should already have taken the Signet Ring from Mauregato's house but if not, go back follow directions in step 4 properly. Give Azuro the key and have him forge the document to allow you entry.
10. Return to the Hotel and speak with the clothing Merchant (Pantaleo) again. You will need 500 gold to buy a Messenger's Attire.
11. Return the the Council Building and the guard will now let you in.
12. Talk to Custodio and Puco in the main room and exhaust all dialog options. You will learn from Custodio that you are the librarian (Cassandra's) "type" which will open up more dialog options with her. While talking to him if you tell him you have to get into the archives > You should really let me in for your own sake > He has a weapon. The only weapon that can be used to fight Mara. > I'm working for the Inquisition > This is about Caldera's saftey (Silver Tongue 80), then he will vouch for you to go into the archives. If you can't get Silver Tongue 80 using items, potions, skills then there is another way in.
13. Go upstairs to the left, then take a right and find Cassandra in a corner office. Talk to her and she will eventually give you a dialog option to buy a spare key to Mauregato's office for 500 gold. Buy the key. There is also an XP reward you can get by completing her dialog "sub-quest": you don't need the Silver Tongue 65 -- in fact it appears to do nothing both times but whatever dialog option you pick she'll give you a quiz. If you answer "Two bookcases and you'll have 15 free slots"  then you'll get an extra 210 Glory (XP). But even if you answer poorly, you will still be able to buy the key and you don't get any discount for the correct answers, just XP.
14. Go back down the hall to Mauregato's office (you passed it on the way to Cassandra). You should now be able to open the quest-locked door.
15. Go inside his office and read his hotes. This will give you the evidence that Azuro is looking for *and* allow one of the books in the archives (that was previously meaningless) to unlock the route.
16. The archives are in the basement-level of the Council Building. If you missed the dialog option with Custodio earlier or did not have Silver Tongue 80 then you still have a few options left for getting in. You can either make your way there directly which will require you to fight a guard OR if you have Lockpick 75, you can head upstairs into the main Council chambers (looks like a cathedral) and unlock a door to a balcony overlooking the archives -- which you can jump down into the archives from. You will probably take some fall damage going this route but if you are careful, it can be kept to a minimum. My worst attempt I took 61 fall damage and my best attempt I took only 3. You'll want to jump onto the ledge itself. Then you can either try to hug the fall and "snag" to throw off the fall damage calculation / land on top of a bookcase, or just jump and hope to get lucky.
17. Once you've gained access to the Archives, read a book in the back left corner titled "High Council Rulings" to learn the location of Maracai Bay. *Note: if you did things out of order, this book will do nothing. It MUST be read after you have collected Mauregato's notes if you wish to unlock Maracai Bay's location*
18. Return to Azuro to complete the quest then tell him that you deserve a reward for an extra 250 gold.


### Option 2: The pure-Voodoo route

Pros: You don't need to spend much gold (100g if you have Pickpocket 74 or less, 0 gold if 75 or above) to complete the quest, you can gain an extra 300 gold
Cons: You can NOT loot the Council Building


1. Follow steps 1-6 for Option 1: The non-Voodoo route but before you leave Mauregato's make sure to also grab the Claim Ticket (which is also in the 1st floor study, in the same room as the key). *Note: If you have Pickpocket 75 (item bonuses included), then you can skip the Claim Ticket and save yourself 100 gold.*
2. Leave Mauregato and go back to the bridge. From there, go straight (it should be slightly uphill) and all the way to the back should be some stairs into a building with a guard on duty. This is the Council Building. Talk to the guard and he'll tell you to piss off.
3. Go to the nearby Hotel and speak with the clothing Merchant (Pantaleo). If you have Pickpocket 75, then just steal Mauregato's wig from him. Otherwise, you'll need to have the Claim Ticket and talk to him, then pay for the wig (100 gold).
4. Head to the 2nd floor of the Hotel and talk to Di Silva. Ask him to let you use his Voodoo altar
5. Create a Voodoo Doll of Mauregato
6. Return to Mauregato's house and possess him with the Voodoo doll
7. As Mauregato, go to the Council Building and turn left/head upstairs to his office. Open the door (Mauregato automatically has his office key) and enter.
8. Read Mauregato's notes
9. Now head back to the main room and take a right down to the basement.
10. Head left from the bottom of the stairs (near the guard) to enter the archives
11. Once you've gained access to the Archives, read a book in the back left corner titled "High Council Rulings" to learn the location of Maracai Bay. *Note: if you did things out of order, this book will do nothing. It MUST be read after you have collected Mauregato's notes if you wish to unlock Maracai Bay's location*
12. Return to the main room. Talk to Custodio and he will mention that a vote is needed. The vote has no story outcome unless you choose fail by both convincing Puco to vote in favor, then resigning, then admitting to treachery (the quest fails because Mauregato is then killed). However, since there is no story effect regardless of the outcome you can use this to gain an extra 300 gold: have Puco and Mauregato reject Mara's offer, then after the vote choose "I have something to say" and "I have expenses to pay".
13. Return to you own body after looting any freestanding items (see note below) to complete the quest.

Note: You can also have Mauregato do all the non-chest related stealing for you to cut down on aggro/having to sneak around, since he can steal without making anyone hostile. He can go right up to Godin and steal the potion from his workbench without issue. Same thing with the "Crab Stabber" on Fernando's worbench, items in Azuro's house and Mauregato's own home, etc.


### Option 3: The hybrid route

Pros: You can loot the Council Building, largest total XP rewards of all 3 options
Cons: Slightly more work, you still have to spend 1000 gold (or 1100 if you have Pickpocketing skill < 75)

1. Follow steps 1-10 for Option 1: The non-Voodoo route to start the quest with Azuro and get Messenger's Attire
2. If you didn't get it already, return to Mauregato's and get the Claim Ticket (which is also in the 1st floor study, in the same room as the key). *Note: If you have Pickpocket 75 (item bonuses included), then you can skip the Claim Ticket and save yourself 100 gold.*
3. Follow steps 2-13 for Option 2: The pure-Voodoo route. *Note that if you don't both get Mauregato's notes AND read the High Council Rulings book, then you will get "Maugegato: Quest Canceled" when you return to your body*
4. Go to the Council Building as yourself.
5. If you talk to Custodio and then Cassandra, you don't need to waste 500 gold on a key to Mauregato's office anymore but you can still use her conversation sub-quest to grab some extra XP. The Silver Tongue options are bugged and don't do anything so it's not worth reloading to change clothes. Pick any option and she'll eventually give you a quiz. If you answer "Two bookcases and you'll have 15 free slots"  then you'll get an extra 210 Glory (XP)
6. Return to Azuro to complete the quest then tell him that you deserve a reward for an extra 250 gold.



## Bonus: How to get into Garcia's room at the Hotel

You will have to spend 500 gold to do this. Talk to Lucia at the Hotel. She will not let you rent Garcia's room because she has a room open already that is ready. First spend 250 gold to rent this room. Then go outside and talk to the street vendor Pollodino. Give him the key to the first room. Then go back to Lucia and tell her you that you gave the first room away and want to rent Garcia's room for an additional 250 gold. She will give you the key to that room and you'll get to loot a couple chests and get an item off the nightstand.
