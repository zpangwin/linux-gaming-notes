To Unlock the Island:

Prerequisites:

* You must own the Treasure Island DLC
* You must have unlocked Maracai Bay (so all of the Maracai Bay prerequisites apply as well). See Unlocking-Maracai-Bay.md for more info.

Steps to Unlock:


1. Complete the initial story arc about Crow (Caldera I -> Tacarigua -> Sword Coast)
2. Get a ship
3. Talk to Patty about her father's treasure
4. Go back to Tacarigua. Go to second story of Booze's place. There is a room where Lola the prostitue hangs out and there is a balcony overlooking the bar. There will be a new chest there. Open it and get a diary page. Talk to Patty again.
5. Go back to the Sword Coast. Set your Map marker. From the beach, go straight (don't turn left to Pirate Watchtower) and you'll find an "X" outside of some temmple ruins. Dig it up then talk to Patty again.
6. Go to Angitua. Go in the first building as you come off the docks and talk to the barkeep. He'll add a map marker to a grave. Go and dig it up then rtalk to Patty again.
7. Now you need to find Harlock. He's on Maracai Bay but you don't know how to get to that either. You'll need to figure out the location of Maracai Bay first.
8. Follow the instructions above for unlocking Maracai Bay.
9. Go to Maracai Bay and find Harlock.
