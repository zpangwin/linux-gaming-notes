## Tools


I may be missing some later game locations for these and I don't really care as this was intended to let me note the earliest locations where you can pick these up. Also note that bonesaw/skinning knife/jaw-chisel tools on Tacarigua and Sword Coast can all be obtained before you pick a side/commit to one faction or the other.

\* Also if you are holding off killing Turkeys and Rats thinking you can do something like possess them later, don't. That's not something voodoo lets you do. But don't worry: You can get a pet monkey that is able to crawl into small holes. As for the passive monkeys you find, you won't be able to tame them yourself later on (monkey tamer skill just lets you use the trained monkeys that some merchants sell). BUT you may want to spare them until you get  a ritual knife and are able to collect Monkey Skulls from them.
