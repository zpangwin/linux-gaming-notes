Sacrificial Knife/Ritual Knife (Voodoo):
-> Sword Coast: You can buy it from the village where you meet Chani after you learn voodoo
-> Possible alternate: When you gain entrance to inner Caldera, From a chest in Captain Garcia's room. And you need relatively high lockpick skill to get it.

I may be missing some later game locations for these and I don't really care as this was intended to let me note the earliest locations where you can pick these up. Also note that bonesaw/skinning knife/jaw-chisel tools on Tacarigua and Sword Coast can all be obtained before you pick a side/commit to one faction or the other.
