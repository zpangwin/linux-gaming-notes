# Advanced Harvesting


## Tool Locations / Prices


I may be missing some later game locations for these and I don't really care as this was intended to let me note the earliest locations where you can pick these up. Also note that bonesaw/skinning knife/jaw-chisel tools on Tacarigua and Sword Coast can all be obtained before you pick a side/commit to one faction or the other.

| Tool           | $$$ | Island      | Area            | Character      | Notes                            |
|:--------------:|:---:|:-----------:|:---------------:|:--------------:|:--------------------------------:|
| Bonesaw        | 100 | Tacarigua   | Plantation      | Ghiles         | Guard near the shack             |
| Bonesaw        | 100 | Tacarigua   | Pirates Den     | Flannigan      | From Barney's, take the bridge   |
| Bonesaw        | 100 | Sword Coast | Puerto Isabella | Sophia         | Bartender in bottom section      |
| Bonesaw        | 100 | Sword Coast | NativeVillage   | Ranapiri       | REQ: Complete gator quest        |
| Skinning Knife | 0   | Sword Coast | Puerto Isabella | Isabella*      | REQ: Silver Tongue 45            |
| Skinning Knife | 0   | Sword Coast | Puerto Isabella | Isabella*      | REQ: Pickpocket + Thievery 50    |
| Skinning Knife | 150 | Sword Coast | Native Village  | Ranapiri       | REQ: Complete gator quest        |
| Jaw-Chisel     | 100 | Sword Coast | Native Village  | Ranapiri       | REQ: Complete gator quest        |
| Ritual Knife   | 250 | Sword Coast | Native Village  | Kupua          | REQ: Choosing sides with Natives |
| Ritual Knife   | 250 | Caldera     | Inner Caldera   | Captain Garcia | ??? REQ: High Lockpick skill ?   |

\* Note: If you meet all the requirements, it is possible to get TWO free skinning knives from Isabella. This allows you to keep one and sell the other for a small profit of 30g.

## Drops by Creature Type

If you plan on using the console, you can use the spawn codes below to spawn the animal you're interested into the game. Note that just like with item codes, the creature codes are case-sensitive, e.g. :

    # spawn a jaguar
    spawn Jaguar
     
    # spawn an alligator
    spawn Alligator
     
    # doesn't recognize other parameters; you'll still just get ONE alligator...
    spawn Alligator 8


Another interesting thing is that the drops available are determined by what tools you are carrying at the time the creature is killed. For example, if you kill one of everything on the list and then use the console to give yourself a Bone Saw with `give It_Bonesaw` , then you still won't have the option to harvest on any creatures you killed beforehand, even on ones that Bone Saw normally works on (such as Claw Monkeys). All killed creatures *after* you acquire whichever tool will work fine though.

\* Also if you are considering holding off killing Turkeys and Rats thinking you can do something like possess them later, then don't bother. Voodoo lets you possess *humans* but not animaals. So Rats/Turkeys/Monkeys are just scenery/pests/free loot+xp depending on how you want to look at it. I *do* recommend leaving the passive monkeys alone until after you get a ritual knife, unless you are 100% uninterested in increasing your Cunning skills, Thievery skill, or using Voodoo. These are the *only* type of Monkey that drop the Monkey Skull item which can later be used to brew permanent Cunning skill increase potions, temporary Thievery skill increase potions, Curse Dolls, and one of the better Voodoo skill amulets. If you don't plan on using voodoo/thievery/tamed monkeys/parrots/silver tongue then they're not much different than rats.

Note: (Human) Skulls and Bones may not be drops; you may need to find/buy those. I am leaving them in here until I confirm it one way or another.
