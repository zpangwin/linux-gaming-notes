Note: The Gamepressure ones don't seem to be complete. For instance, they are missing Chavez (a solider wandering around just outside of Puerto Isabella) and Lin (outside Native village). Possibly others as well. I think it might also be missing the Lighthouse keeper (Jack) on Tacarigua (needs to be confirmed)
