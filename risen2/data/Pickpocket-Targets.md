Note: The Gamepressure ones don't seem to be complete. For instance, they are missing Chavez (a solider wandering around just outside of Puerto Isabella) and Lin (outside Native village). Possibly others as well. I think it might also be missing the Lighthouse keeper (Jack) on Tacarigua (needs to be confirmed)


## Pickpocket Charts

This section is for being able to reference the maximum pickpocket level you can successfully steal from targets with various combinations of Cunning ranks, skills, items, and potions. Since the permanent potion is rare and doesn't increase Thievery by 5 or more in one go, I am omitting that from the charts because it is a pain to manage all the extra permutations that adds in.

These charts will start at the minimum cunning level needed for each scenario and work their way up. Then it will plot the same thing out against various combinations of items. Rinse and repeat for the next skill level and the one after that. You will **always** need to have purchased the Picklocking talent to open locks which requires Cunning 4 or higher; so these charts will not be showing anything below Cunning 4 since you can't pick locks without that anyway.


### Pickpocket Only:

Pickpocket: Minimum Cunning 2
