\* This plant gives an immediate and permanent +1 bonus to the TALENTS for that Attribute if consumed now OR it can be used to make a potion later that gives a permanent +2 bonus to the same talents. Note that this is differenet than a +1/+2 to the Attribute itself (which would give +5/+10 to those talents, respectively).

\*\* If you meet both requirements, it is possible to get 2 free Skinning Knives from Isabella. You can keep one and sell the other for a small profit.

Quest\*: Technically, you can get into the building for free by possessing someone using Voodoo but your target can't pick locks. You'll have to come back later as yourself if you plan on looting. If you aren't using Voodoo or you want to loot the place, you'll need to pay 500g for a disguise.

Quest\*\*: This assumes you have paid the 500g for the disguise so you can loot the building. If you did Voodoo, you can possess the Mauregato and have him open his office door then come back later for the chest. If you did Inquisition, you will have to pay an extra 500g to bribe Cassandra for a key.

Quest \*\*\* To get into Garcia's room, you'll have to spend 500g. First, talk to the innkeeper. She won't let you rent Garcia's room because she "already has a room available". Rent that other room for 250g. When you talk to her again, she'll say "you already have a room". Go back onto the street and find the Merchant Possodino nearby. Give him your room key. Then go back and talk to the innkeeper again and ask to rent Garcia's room for 250g.




TODO: Reload old saves and confirm if I got all of the freebies from buried treasure chests. it looks like i have the one from petes treasure on TAK. not sure about: o'brians treasure on TAK, isabella's treasure on SWC, others
