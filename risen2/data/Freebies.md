\* This plant gives an immediate and permanent +1 bonus to the TALENTS for that Attribute if consumed now OR it can be used to make a potion later that gives a permanent +2 bonus to the same talents. Note that this is differenet than a +1/+2 to the Attribute itself (which would give +5/+10 to those talents, respectively).

\*\* If you meet both requirements, it is possible to get 2 free Skinning Knives from Isabella. You can keep one and sell the other for a small profit.
