## Lockpick Charts

This section is for being able to reference the maximum lock level you can successfully unlock with various combinations of Cunning ranks, skills, items, and potions. Since the permanent potion is rare and doesn't increase Thievery by 5 or more in one go, I am omitting that from the charts because it is a pain to manage all the extra permutations that adds in.

These charts will start at the minimum cunning level needed for each scenario and work their way up. Then it will plot the same thing out against various combinations of items. Rinse and repeat for the next skill level and the one after that. You will **always** need to have purchased the Picklocking talent to open locks which requires Cunning 4 or higher; so these charts will not be showing anything below Cunning 4 since you can't pick locks without that anyway.
