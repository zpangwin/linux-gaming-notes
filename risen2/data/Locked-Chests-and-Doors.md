# Locked Chests and Doors

This notes the locations, lockpick level required, and any notable items of locked chests and doors in the game. For what counts as a "notable item"; I won't mention gold, provisions, goblets, and such that is basically just food/alcohol/standard sellable loot. But if there is a quest-item, unique item, potion, rare item, or equipment I will mention it.

To strategize how to ocmbine items, talents, and attribute increases to allow yourself to pick higher level locks, see the last section which contains tables that plot these values out for you.


For determining which Items x Potions x Skills x Attributes you need to complete a particular Lockpick difficulty level, see Lockpick-Charts.md

## Caldera I

**Note: You won't be able to get the Lockpicking skill before leaving the island (without cheating at least)**

You might still notice these chests for later (or not, as I'll mention them again in the "Caldera II" section)
