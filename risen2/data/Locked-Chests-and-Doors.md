# Locked Chests and Doors

This notes the locations, lockpick level required, and any notable items of locked chests and doors in the game. For what counts as a "notable item"; I won't mention gold, provisions, goblets, and such that is basically just food/alcohol/standard sellable loot. But if there is a quest-item, unique item, potion, rare item, or equipment I will mention it.

To strategize how to ocmbine items, talents, and attribute increases to allow yourself to pick higher level locks, see the last section which contains tables that plot these values out for you.

## Caldera I

**Note: You won't be able to get the Lockpicking skill before leaving the island (without cheating at least)**

You might still notice these chests for later (or not, as I'll mention them again in the "Caldera II" section)

## Lockpick Charts

This section is for being able to reference the maximum lock level you can successfully unlock with various combinations of Cunning ranks, skills, items, and potions. Since the permanent potion is rare and doesn't increase Thievery by 5 or more in one go, I am omitting that from the charts because it is a pain to manage all the extra permutations that adds in.

These charts will start at the minimum cunning level needed for each scenario and work their way up. Then it will plot the same thing out against various combinations of items. Rinse and repeat for the next skill level and the one after that. You will **always** need to have purchased the Picklocking talent to open locks which requires Cunning 4 or higher; so these charts will not be showing anything below Cunning 4 since you can't pick locks without that anyway.


### Lockpicking Only:

Lockpicking: Minimum Cunning 4

Reminder: The table columns are using *base* Cunning Level (e.g. without bonuses)
